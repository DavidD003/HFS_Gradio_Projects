# HFS_Gradio_Projects
A repository for me to store files related to my HFS/Gradio projects so I can take advantage of the tools github offers.

Each directory corresponds to one HFS/Gradio space, which is a publicly available API (user and machine friendly aspects) which provides a means of using python ( or other) functions via the internet
